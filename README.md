# Final-Year-Project
This is my final year project.

# Mulimodal Human Activity Detection
We have used two sensors one ia grid-eye (Thermal) sensor and the other one is sound sensor. The ultimate goal of this project is to make a product for the eldrly people who live in thir rooms alone. This model will monitor the daily activities of a person and predict their routine. The major use case of this model is to detect fall of a person. If the fall happens then it will generate the alarm which will be shown through the mobile application.

# Modal
The following is the modal that we came up with by doing extensive research.
